# WEB102 Prework - Transparent Tracks

Submitted by: Julia Marie Bacud

Transparent Tracks is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

CSS Styling
* [X] Changed the header, body, and font colors to what I think is a more aesthetic combination, while still fulfilling the "Sea Monster" concept
* [X] Applied pointer, box shadow, and color to each individual stats card (rather than the whole container) to give visitors time to digest the highlighted information on each card 
* [X] Added hover and active customizations to the unfunded/funded/all buttons so that they stand out more, and so that visitors get the satisfying feeling of clicking a button
* [X] Transformed the scaling on individual stats cards and game cards so that the information they view stands out from the rest while reading

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

I was familiar with HTML and CSS but knew little about Javascript, so I actually started and completed an introductory JS course on Codecademy before starting the WEB102 Prework. The prework itself actually acted as a great, challenging, in-depth review of what I had just learnt of the language.

It took me time to understand how the different functions we created in the challenges worked with the GAMES_JSON array. Additionally, I wasn't familiar with the process of creating DOM elements and appending it to specific containers. Though, since the prework requests us to do both many times, I had a lot of practice and am proud to say I have a greater understanding of how Javascript intertwines with CSS and HTML to create a website's functionality.
